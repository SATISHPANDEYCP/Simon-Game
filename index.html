                <h2>Welcome to Simon Says!</h2>
                <p>Simon Says is an engaging memory game where you need to repeat a sequence of colors shown by the
                    game. The sequence gets longer and more complex as you advance through levels.</p>

                <h3>Game Rules:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Memorize and repeat the sequence of colors shown by the game. Each
                        round adds a new color to the sequence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Starting the Game:</strong> The game begins when you click anywhere on your screen. The
                        game will display a sequence of colors one by one.</li>
                    <li><strong>Following the Sequence:</strong> After the sequence is shown, replicate it by clicking
                        the colored buttons in the same order. Success will advance you to the next level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Levels and Scoring:</strong> Each correct sequence increases your level and score. Your
                        score is the product of your current level and score.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incorrect Sequence:</strong> If you click the buttons incorrectly, the game ends. Your
                        final score will be shown, and you can start over.</li>
                    <li><strong>High Score:</strong> The game tracks your highest score. If you achieve a new high
                        score, it will be displayed after the game ends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tips:</strong> Carefully remember the sequence and react quickly to score the highest
                        possible. The game becomes more challenging as you progress.</li>
                </ul>
